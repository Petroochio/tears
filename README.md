#### Panels 1 & 2: ambient animations on stars, Earth, debris, and explosion

#### Interface: model received
- the alien has sent a model of something
- there are 3 sets of data
- you need to map the data to the X, Y, and Z co-ordinates
- click on X, Y, and Z buttons at the bottom to cycle the data
- when correct, the data becomes a model of the solar system
- we can see the alien is near Uranus, which is why it took ~2 hours for the message to arrive
